                            <li>Teams must show up and be ready to play no longer than 5 minutes after the scheduled game time. Failing to meet this obligation will result in an automatic forfeit, and a team loss. No compensation will be given. </li><br>
                            <li>A team must have at least 4 eligible players on the floor to play. Failure to meet this obligation will lead to a forfeit. No compensation will be given. </li><br>
                            <li>Be respectful of other players, and the refs. Though ANKLEBREAKER does encourage competitiveness, it does not tolerate the use of offensive language, and any behaviour that compromises the safety of the players, and the referees. Players will be assigned technical fouls for unsportsmen-like behaviour. If a player accumulates over 2 technical fouls over the course of the tournament, they will be for suspended for one-game following every additional technical foul they received.</li><br>
                            <li>Fair play of the entire team will be assessed after every game. If a team shows consistently poor fair play, even after warnings, the team will be disqualified from the league without compensation. </li><br>
